# LotkaVolterraProject

Code for my Math 532H project on the Lotka-Volterra model and some of its variants.

The code for producing each figure of the writeup is in the corresponding `.py` file.
Note that numpy, matplotlib, and scipy are required to run these scripts.

The Mathematica notebook is rather short and included for completeness.

The `.png` files for the figures can be found in the `images` directory.
